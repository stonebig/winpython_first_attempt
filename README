    Overview

        WinPython is a portable distribution of the Python programming 
        language for Windows.

        It is a full-featured Python-based scientific environment:

            Designed for:
                Regular scientific users: interactive data processing and 
                visualization using Python with Spyder (thanks to the 
                integrated libraries NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, guiqwt, etc.)

                Advanced scientific users and software developers: Python 
                applications development with Spyder (based on the integrated 
                libraries NumPy, SciPy, PyQt, h5py, guidata, guiqwt, etc.), 
                version control with Mercurial and other development tools 
                (like gettext, WinMerge, etc.)

            Portable: preconfigured, it should run out of the box on any 
            machine under Windows (without any installation requirements) 
            and the folder containing WinPython can be moved to any location 
            (local, network or removable drive)

            Flexible: one can install (or should I write "use" as it's 
            portable) as many WinPython versions as necessary (like isolated 
            and self-consistent environments), even if those versions are 
            running different versions of Python (2.7, 3.x in the near future) 
            or different architectures (32bit or 64bit) on the same machine

            Customizable: using the integrated package manager (wppm, as 
            WinPython Package Manager), it's possible to install or uninstall 
            any standard Python package built with distutils 
            (e.g. "dummypackage-2.1.win-amd64-py2.7.‌exe").

    Dependencies
    
        Python 2.6+
        PyQt4 4.5+ or PySide 1.1.1+ (PyQt4 is recommended)
        spyderlib 2.1+

    Installation
    
        From the source package (see section 'Building dependencies'), you may 
        install WinPython using the integrated setup.py script based on Python 
        standard library `distutils` with the following command:
            `python setup.py install`

        Note that `distutils` does *not* uninstall previous versions of Python 
        packages: it simply copies files on top of an existing installation. 
        When using this command, it is thus highly recommended to uninstall 
        manually any previous version of WinPython by removing the associated 
        directory ('winpython' in your site-packages directory).

        From the Python package index, you may simply install WinPython *and* 
        upgrade an existing installation using `pip`:
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi

        But the easiest way to install the last stable release of WinPython is by using an executable installer: http://winpython.googlecode.com
