    Overview

        WinPython is a portable distribution of the Python programming 
        language for Windows (http://winpython.sourceforge.net/).
		
		This is the `winpython` Python package, not the distribution itself.
		It includes two main features:

			The WinPython Package Manager (WPPM): let you install/uninstall 
            to your WinPython distribution any standard Python package built 
			with distutils (e.g. "dummypackage-2.1.win-amd64-py3.4.‌exe")
			or with wheels (e.g. "dummypackage-2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl")
			
			The WinPython build toolchain: make.py is the script used to 
			build a WinPython distribution from (almost) scratch.

    Dependencies
    
        Python2 >= 2.7 or Python3 >= 3.3 
        PyQt4 >= 4.6 or PySide >= 1.2 (PyQt4 is recommended)
        pip >= 1.5.4 and setuptools >= 3.4.4
        guidata >= 1.6.1

    Requirements

        7zip (directory has to be available in PATH)
        NSIS:
          * "Large strings" special build (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Special_Builds)
          * with TextReplace plugin installed
        Microsoft Visual C++ DLLs -- the versions have to be the same as the 
        one used to build your Python installation. For example, when using the
        official Python 2.7 build, you will need v9.0.21022.8:
          * 32bit: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29
          * 64bit: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=15336

    Installation
    
        From the source package (see section 'Building dependencies'), you may 
        install WinPython using the integrated setup.py script based on Python 
        standard library `distutils` with the following command:
            `python setup.py install`

        Note that `distutils` does *not* uninstall previous versions of Python 
        packages: it simply copies files on top of an existing installation. 
        When using this command, it is thus highly recommended to uninstall 
        manually any previous version of WinPython by removing the associated 
        directory ('winpython' in your site-packages directory).

        From the Python package index, you may simply install WinPython *and* 
        upgrade an existing installation using `pip`:
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi

        But the easiest way to install the last stable release of WinPython is 
		by using an executable installer: http://winpython.googlecode.com
